- create tournament in series

- create series from UI

- minimal css

- add cost field to staking contract (automatically generated?)

- in `create_staking_contract`, I need to check that staker, tournament, user
actually exist in the database; how to do that? --- assoc_constraint maybe?

- add uniqueness constraint of email, and all other constraints necessary

- maybe remove many to many join table users_tournaments.

- maybe remove timestamps()?

- update tournament table to have an entry cost/fee, maybe No of entries, any other data?

- user authentication/session to support multiple users


### Features for later on:

- Staker view (a staker can only see what they staked on, without seeing other stakers)

- emails for winnings, summary, etc..

- sweat patch (player can create a live feed for stakers and friends to know how they're doing and provide supports)
